# Embers
Embers is best described as a dwarven magic mod. It features a smattering of magical and technical content, from staples such as ore doubling and item transport to alchemy and magical ray guns. All centered around the core mechanic of Ember, a limited form of power that you must extract from the world's core near bedrock.
